# September 14: Planning

I was bored waiting for the parts to arrive for my flight controller, so I started browsing Oshwlab looking for cool projects. I kept seeing a bunch of devboards, but they were all specialized for one chip. After my two neurons grasped that fact, I realized that I had never seen a multi-devboard. They were all specialized boards for one chip, but there wasn't one for a wide range of chips, so I decided to change that.

I brainstormed a cool name for the project and the general form of the board. Originally I wanted it to be called "Biblically Accurate Devboard," but I didn't really have the means to make it 3D, so I decided to use another name. Taking inspiration from mythology, as always, I decided on the name Odin because he's an all-knowing god who sacrificed an eye (this devboard) for knowledge, so it kind of fits.

Now comes the fun part of selecting the number and type of chips on the board.

- STM32H743VGT6
- ESP32-WROOM-32E-N8
- RP2350A
- LFE5U-85F-7BG381I (I <3 FPGA)
- nRF5340
- ATmega328P (Arduino :0)
- CH32V003 (Open ISA)
- ~K230 (OTG AI Slop!)~
- PIC18F4550
- 74Cxx gates (Gatekeeper)

I started by finding a USB hub that has seven ports to connect all the chips, and then I started with the STM and the ESP32. Then I finished the Raspberry Pi section by looking at a reference design from JLCPCB.

## 10/7/2025 3:33 PM - September 15: More Schematic Design  

I started working on the other chips' designs, more specifically the CH32V003. I was looking into how to connect it to USB-C and found an open-source repo that bitbangs two pins to create a USB interface to program it: https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb.

After wiring that up I finished with the ATmega and then started working on the FPGA. I had no idea how to connect an FPGA beforehand, but I saw Cheyao's icepi, so I at least had a reference design for the HMI and USB-C ports: https://github.com/cheyao/icepi-zero. I still got stuck as I had to plan everything, looking at both the footprint and the reference schematic, and also a sheet that lists every pin for both FPGAs that I made.

It was mentally straining and I was feeling burned out, so I went to sleep.
