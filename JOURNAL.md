# September 14: Planning

I was bored waiting for the parts to arrive for my flight controller, so I started browsing Oshwlab looking for cool projects. I kept seeing a bunch of devboards, but they were all specialized for one chip. After my two neurons grasped that fact, I realized that I had never seen a multi-devboard. They were all specialized boards for one chip, but there wasn't one for a wide range of chips, so I decided to change that.

I brainstormed a cool name for the project and the general form of the board. Originally I wanted it to be called "Biblically Accurate Devboard," but I didn't really have the means to make it 3D, so I decided to use another name. Taking inspiration from mythology, as always, I decided on the name Odin because he's an all-knowing god who sacrificed an eye (this devboard) for knowledge, so it kind of fits.

Now comes the fun part of selecting the number and type of chips on the board.

- STM32H743VGT6
- ESP32-WROOM-32E-N8
- RP2350A
- LFE5U-85F-7BG381I (I <3 FPGA)
- nRF5340
- ATmega328P (Arduino :0)
- CH32V003 (Open ISA)
- ~K230 (OTG AI Slop!)~
- PIC18F4550
- 74Cxx gates (Gatekeeper)

I started by finding a USB hub that has seven ports to connect all the chips, and then I started with the STM and the ESP32. Then I finished the Raspberry Pi section by looking at a reference design from JLCPCB.
