# September 14: Planning

I was bored waiting for the parts to arrive for my flight controller, so I started browsing Oshwlab looking for cool projects. I kept seeing a bunch of devboards, but they were all specialized for one chip. After my two neurons grasped that fact, I realized that I had never seen a multi-devboard. They were all specialized boards for one chip, but there wasn't one for a wide range of chips, so I decided to change that.

I brainstormed a cool name for the project and the general form of the board. Originally I wanted it to be called "Biblically Accurate Devboard," but I didn't really have the means to make it 3D, so I decided to use another name. Taking inspiration from mythology, as always, I decided on the name Odin because he's an all-knowing god who sacrificed an eye (this devboard) for knowledge, so it kind of fits.

Now comes the fun part of selecting the number and type of chips on the board.

- STM32H743VGT6
- ESP32-WROOM-32E-N8
- RP2350A
- LFE5U-85F-7BG381I (I <3 FPGA)
- nRF5340
- ATmega328P (Arduino :0)
- CH32V003 (Open ISA)
- ~K230 (OTG AI Slop!)~
- PIC18F4550
- 74Cxx gates (Gatekeeper)

ATmega: https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/Arduino_Nano-Rev3.2-SCH.pdf

I started by finding a USB hub that has seven ports to connect all the chips, and then I started with the STM and the ESP32. Then I finished the Raspberry Pi section by looking at a reference design from JLCPCB.

## 10/7/2025 3:33 PM - September 15: More Schematic Design  

I started working on the other chips' designs, more specifically the CH32V003. I was looking into how to connect it to USB-C and found an open-source repo that bitbangs two pins to create a USB interface to program it: https://github.com/cnlohr/rv003usb.

After wiring that up I finished with the ATmega and then started working on the FPGA. I had no idea how to connect an FPGA beforehand, but I saw Cheyao's icepi, so I at least had a reference design for the HMI and USB-C ports: https://github.com/cheyao/icepi-zero. I still got stuck as I had to plan everything, looking at both the footprint and the reference schematic, and also a sheet that lists every pin for both FPGAs that I made.

It was mentally straining and I was feeling burned out, so I went to sleep.  

## 10/7/2025 3:35 PM - September 16: Finished FPGA and Start of ~~K230~~  

I finally finished the FPGA and the nRF chip (still need to add headers on all of the chips) and then decided to start on the K230, as it is a machine learning chip and I wanted this board to be super powerful.

After a while looking into the documentation I decided to scrap the K230 for time purposes and also because it was too complicated in the current timeframe, so I opted for something retro to learn how to write assembly: PIC18F4550

## 10/7/2025 3:48 PM - Future Steps  

I had started this project during Grounded but I got really burnt out for a while and didn't want to touch any project at all so now I'm trying to get back in to finish this project so I can work on another flight controller (@CAN ts ones gonna be better). 

The most time consuming and tedious part is placing all of the headers and putting them in the right places for each microcontroller. I am starting with the ESP32 and then working my way around the board but I should really start with the side opposite of the FPGA (bc the FPGA has alot of pins lmao). I'm gonna start wiring that up bit by bit and also complete some of the schematics for the PIC and add in any other peripherals that I would need (sensors?, LED's?)
